# Jazz Chord Flashcards

The Jazz Chord Trainer is a web application designed to help musicians practice jazz chords in an interactive and structured way. The app displays random chord flashcards (e.g., Cmaj7, G7, Dm7) on the screen, challenging users to play them in time with the specified tempo.

With a built-in tempo control, users can adjust the speed to match their skill level, making it useable for beginners and advanced players alike.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
